SYSTEM ARCHITECUTE AND DESIGN:

1. Frontend:
User Interface (UI):
Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React for component-based architecture).
Components: Login screen, timer display, control buttons (start, pause, reset), settings panel, and report view.
Chrome Extension:
Manifest File: Defines extension permissions and configurations.
Popup UI and Options Page: Allows users to interact with the Pomodoro timer and configure settings.
Widget:
Embedded UI: Similar to the extension, embedded on websites or as a standalone widget.
2. Backend Services:
Authentication Service:
User Authentication: Use OAuth (e.g., Google, GitHub) or a custom username/password system with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management.
API Endpoints:
Timer API: Handles operations like starting, pausing, and resetting the timer.
Report API: Stores session data and generates reports.
Export API: Allows users to export reports in formats like CSV or PDF.
Serverless Architecture: Use serverless functions (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or Firebase Functions) to reduce costs and simplify backend management.
3. Database:
NoSQL Database: Use Firebase Firestore, MongoDB Atlas, or another NoSQL database for flexible schema management.
Collections:
Users: Stores user profiles and authentication details.
Reports: Stores session data, including timestamps, durations, and types (work, break).
Settings: User-specific settings for Pomodoro intervals and preferences.
4. Storage and Syncing:
Local and Cloud Storage:
Local Storage: Store temporary session data and user settings locally.
Cloud Sync: Sync critical data (reports, settings) with the cloud database for persistence and cross-device access.
5. Notifications and Alarms:
Notification API: Alerts for work/break transitions.
Alarms API (Chrome Extension): Manages timing and ensures the timer runs even when the UI is closed.

Workflow:
User Login: Users log in via OAuth or a custom authentication system. A session token is issued.
Timer Operations: Timer functions (start, pause, reset) are handled on the frontend and synced with the backend for persistence.
Report Generation and Storage: Session data is sent to the backend, where reports are generated and stored in the cloud database.
Exporting Reports: Users can export their session data as CSV or PDF via the Export API.
Data Syncing: All settings and reports are synced between the frontend and backend, allowing for cross-device access.
Considerations for Learning and Zero Cost:
Use Free Tiers: Leverage free tiers of cloud services like Firebase for authentication and database, or GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
Minimize Backend Complexity: Use serverless functions to avoid managing servers and to keep costs down.
Focus on Learning: Prioritize understanding each component's role and how they interact over advanced features to ensure a solid grasp of full-stack development.
